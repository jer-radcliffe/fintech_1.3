Who are you? What is your background?

My name is Jeremy Radcliffe.  I'm a senior mortgage banker and a ten year veteran in the industry.  I hold a Bachelors of Business Administration degree from Baylor Univerity with an emphasis in Management Information Systems.  I was a software developer for four years post graduation and then moved overseas as a missionary for 6 years in North Africa.  On returning from living overseas I wanted to move into a sales role but found that the mortage industry provided a good balance of technical and relational outlets.

To grow in my coding skills and ability to manage large sets of data.  I want to be ahead of the changes in our industry and to be able to use the large data sets to evaluate opportunities.


Why did you choose FinTech as a career path?

It seems to have chosen me.  I was not aware this even existed.
